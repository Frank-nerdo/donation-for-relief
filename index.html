            <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
            <p>Shelter comes as people are still in danger of nature, because the flash flood is only created by the rain and the
            shelter keeps the affected people safe and dry from on coming threats.</p>

            <p>This disaster has created disadvantages. But above all the people the most affected are the children as they are not
            fully understanding the situation. This situation has backdated the prosperity of their future for them and the nation.</p>
